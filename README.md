Term 1 10.014 CTD 1D game project - tictactoe, but both players start out with a fixed amount of money, and you have to bid higher than your opponent to actually be able to play your turn, and whatever if you win the bet the money you bet goes to your opponent. If you consistently bet too low your opponent could win by making more turns than you do, but bettng too high might be catastrophic as well as your opponent would be able to outbid you in future moves.  

Made with python, tkinter, and pyrebase (firebase python API library) for online multiplayer
